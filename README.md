# functional-interpreter
**Old CS course project assignment written in OCaml.**
The project is an implementation of an interpreter for a simple functional programming language that includes the following primitives: 
+ Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, product and division) 
on integers
+ Logical operators (negation, conjunction, disjunction) on booleans
+ Comparison operators (equality, comparison to zero)
+ Identifiers and top-level (global) bindings 
+ Recursive top-level bindings
+ Anonymous functions (which can be bound to an identifier)
+ Conditional constructs (if-then-else)
+ Tuple datatype and operators (Head, Tail, Cons)
+ Pipe operator - which is basically a list of closures 
+ ManyTimes opeartor - which applies an expression many times to an integer
